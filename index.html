        <div class="subheading mb-5">Sociology</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Tinomuda Tugwete. I’m a sociology major and have an array of interests including fashion as featured on this page. My work experience has been overall relating to working with organizations or people particularly in the teen and young adult category. This experience has taught me a lot about working with peer groups and maintaining professional and instructional status amongst those kinds of groups. I really enjoy teaching curriculum and being able to guide people into reaching their own goals and potential. I also enjoy creating curriculum particularly surrounding social issues and social justice causes. Some of the curriculum I’ve been a part of teaching includes works from Martin Luther King Jr. and Gandhi in regards to nonviolence and mindfulness practices. The organizations I've worked with have allowed me to explore this passion and I'm always ready to expand my knowledge and experience.
<br><br>

        Working with Lead with Soulforce has given me much of my coaching and leading experience as I was required to help create a 5 week program and lead around 20 students each summer for three summers. With my experience I was able to end my experience as a member of the advisory board and because of that I was able to help organize events at places like facebook and google. I have experience working with different groups of people from different backgrounds because of this experience and I think that it's a valuable skill I've picked up. I value making sure every voice is heard in any workspace I enter and because of my background in social work I know how to do this well. Practices like deep and active listening are important skills I've gained from my work experience as well which helps when it's time to work on a team and make sure the best of everyone is seen and heard.
<br><br>

        Working as an orientation leader has also taught me a lot about working with people and managing the health and well being of large groups of people while also giving that same group important and supportive information. There were many times last minute changes were made to the program and having a calm and flexible demeanor assisted me greatly. This job required over 100 hours of training as the orientation was a two day program. The days were long and hot but taking care of myself and the many students I had taught me how to maintain physical and mental health even under stressful outside circumstances. I loved being able to make someone’s experience of my campus safe and informative as well as entertaining and challenging. I created many ice breakers and activities to help keep my students awake and was able to form some mentor relationships from the experience as well. There were many times students had health concerns and difficulties that made me have to reconsider how I would move through the next two days but again flexibility and adaptability came to mind and I was able to work with my supervisors and create a more efficient plan for the day that still allowed all my students to have a fantastic and shared experience with the program and campus.
